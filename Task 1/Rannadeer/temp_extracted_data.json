They are optimized for similarity search operations, which are essential for applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and image recognition. Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact match queries, vector databases can find items that are similar but not identical to the query.",

In Python, the json module provides methods to encode Python objects as JSON strings and decode JSON strings into Python objects. The two main methods are json.dumps() for serializing and json.loads() for deserializing. When working with files, you can use json.dump() and json.load() instead.",
